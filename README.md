# Music-Player

A browser-based music player built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with a custom implementation of the **Linked List** data structure to manage playlist traversal. This project demonstrates the application of data structures in frontend development by enabling smooth navigation between songs (next/previous) through linked list logic.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Navigate between songs using Linked List traversal
- 🎧 Audio playback using native HTML5 `<audio>` tag
- 💾 Capable of handling up to 50+ songs with efficient memory usage

## 📂 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure of the application  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Logic for playback and data structure implementation

## 🧠 Data Structure Used

- Implemented a **doubly linked list** to store and traverse the playlist
- Each node contains:
  - `title`: Name of the song
  - `file`: Path to the audio file
  - `next` and `prev` pointers for navigation
